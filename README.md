# 🍎 DPL HW3 - Fruit Image Analysis

This repository contains the code for the third homework assignment of the **DPL course at CTU**. The task involves training a neural network to:
- 🏷️ **Classify** images of fruits into 30 different categories
- 🎨 **Segment** fruits with pixel-level masks
- 🔍 **Learn** meaningful image embeddings

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository
```bash
git clone git@github.com:urob-ctu/hw3-cnns.git
```

### 2️⃣ Set up your environment
Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Download the dataset
Download the dataset and place it in the `data/` directory: [Dataset Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cnD0vsuPSM-lkV4zqCxvXYihuvc6s7PF/view?usp=sharing)

### 4️⃣ Configure your experiment
Modify the configuration file in `confs/config.yml` as needed.

### 5️⃣ Train the model
- Define your model in `model.py`
- Fill the missing lines in `train.py` (look for ‼️‼️‼️‼️) [or write your own training script but then submit this training script as `train.py`]
- Run the training script:
```bash
python train.py
```

### 6️⃣ (Optional) Use SLURM cluster
If using a SLURM cluster, submit the job using:
```bash
sbatch train_job.sbatch
```

## ✅ Your Tasks

1. 🏗️ **Implement** the neural network architecture in `model.py`
   - must be named `MyModel` and accept `output_size` as an argument (output_size should be 30 for 30 fruit classes)
   - `forward` method must return three outputs:
     - class logits (shape: `[batch_size, 30]`)
     - segmentation mask (shape: `[batch_size, 1, 64, 64]`)
     - image embeddings (shape: `[batch_size, embedding_dim]`)
    - `get_embedding` method must return single output:
      - image embeddings (shape: `[batch_size, embedding_dim]`)
2. 🔄 **Complete** the training loop in `train.py` (look for ‼️‼️‼️‼️)
3. ⚙️ **Tune** hyperparameters in `confs/config.yml` for optimal performance
   - use tensorboard to monitor training progress: `tensorboard --logdir {path_to_logs}`
4. 📋 **LLM statement**: create a file `llm_declaration.txt` where you briefly describe how and where you used LLMs while solving the task.

## 🚫 Important Policies

### 🤖 Pretrained Models Policy
❌ You are **not allowed** to use any pretrained models or transfer learning techniques.  
✅ All models **must be trained from scratch** using the provided dataset and your training code that you submit.

### 📝 Plagiarism Policy
✅ You are **strongly encouraged** to discuss ideas and approaches with your peers.  
⚠️ However, the code you submit **must be your own work** and you must fully understand it.
❌ Copying code from others is **strictly prohibited** and will result in a **zero score** for the assignment.
